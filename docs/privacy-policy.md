# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

---

## Privacy First

TheLogger is designed with your privacy as a priority. All your workout data stays on your device and is never sent to external servers.

---

## Data Collection

TheLogger collects and stores the following data locally on your device:

- Workout history (exercises, sets, weights, reps)
- Personal records
- Workout templates
- User preferences (name, units, settings)
- Exercise notes

This data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework and never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

---

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage mechanisms. We do not use:

- Cloud servers
- Third-party analytics
- Advertising networks
- User tracking

Your data remains under your complete control at all times.

---

## Data Export

You can export your workout history as a CSV file at any time through the app's export feature. This exported file is created locally and you choose where to save or share it.

---

## Third-Party Services

TheLogger does not integrate with any third-party services. The app functions entirely offline and does not require an internet connection.

---

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time by:

- Deleting individual workouts within the app
- Uninstalling the app (removes all app data)

There is no cloud backup, so deletion is permanent.

---

## Children's Privacy

TheLogger does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app is designed for general audiences and contains no age-restricted content.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated "Last updated" date.

---

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the App Store.

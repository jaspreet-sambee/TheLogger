## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ Good News: Many Features Already Implemented!

TheLogger has already implemented most critical features:

- ✅ Smart workout naming (exercise-based, time-based, type detection)
- ✅ Previous set indicators (per-set comparison)
- ✅ Weight quick-adjust buttons (+5/-5, +2.5/-2.5)
- ✅ Recent exercises on empty workout (quick-add buttons)
- ✅ Set type distinction (warmup vs working)
- ✅ Haptic feedback throughout

### ⚠️ Remaining Friction Points

1. **Exercise Reordering** - Requires Edit mode (not discoverable)
2. **Rest Timer** - Manual-only (no auto-start option)
3. **History Cards** - Missing exercise names (can't tell workout type)
4. **Exercise Notes** - Hidden by default (should show on card)
5. **Superset Support** - Not implemented
